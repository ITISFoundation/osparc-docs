The willingness to participate in the interviews to discuss team-specific needs and 
requirements
was high. There is important enthusiasm about both the possibility of
sharing own models in a friendly way, without having to invest a lot in
developing user-interface functionality, and the potential of getting
access to powerful solvers, meta-modeling functionality,
electrophysiology models, and analysis tools. Quality assurance aspects,
data and model integration, user-friendliness, computational
infrastructure, anatomical models, and support for workflows are other
highly valued components. The platform concept, as developed throughout
the SIM-CORE application process, appears to be very well suited to the
requirements, with few extensions being required (support for
"supercomputing", workflows (s. side-car concept below), nerve
microstructure modeling, support for thermal, biomechanical, and light
propagation modeling (IT'IS does not have solvers for the latter two),
machine learning, additional animal anatomical models, as well as a
detailed spinal cord model, modeling of fields generated by neural
activity for sensing, and further meta-modeling (control, model order
reduction)). Certain aspects do not seem to currently be of high priority
(e.g., image-processing beyond segmentation, functionality for users to implement their 
own, advanced-interaction GUI-elements).
Providing users with proper support will be fundamental to assure the
widespread adoption of the platform.
