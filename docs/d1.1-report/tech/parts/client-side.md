## Frameworks

The front-end part corresponds to the software running on the client
side. The server-side transmits the program/instructions to the web-
browser on the client-side which interprets and executes them. The
front-end interacts directly with the user and, for that reason, one of
the main features of front-end frameworks is the 
GUI. Among the wide variety of frameworks that support the development
of front-ends we pre-selected: [vue], [react] and [qooxdoo].

In order to compare advantages and disadvantages of the different
frameworks, prototype Single-Page-Applications were built for each
framework with similar User Interfaces and features.

The following components/aspects were reviewed:

- **Interactive layout** : The layout consists of at least four main
components: Available services, Settings viewer, 3D renderer and
Workbench. The user should be able to interact with the sizing/positioning
of those components. A Results viewer was also implemented for the [react]
and [qooxdoo] prototypes.
- **3D renderer** : The 3D viewer shows an interactive object. [three.js],
the most popular JavaScript library that uses [WebGL], was used for all
four prototypes.
- **Workbench** : The workbench shows how the different computational
services are connected to form a pipeline.
- **Data binding in UI** : All the information used in the frontend is
contained in a JSON object. This data needs to be converted to something
meaningful for the user so that the complexity behind it turns into
buttons, text/number inputs, etc.
- **Dynamic styling** : By clicking a checkbox or dropdown menu, the GUI
style should be switchable. This is a measure for the flexibility in creating a user-friendly and 
attractive GUI by strongly separating design from style.
- **Front-end/Back-end communication** : Some logic is implemented on the
client-side, but the heaviest logic stays on the server side. Thus, the
client needs to communicate with the server (e.g., when the web
application is started it needs to ask the server about the available
services). For [vue], [react] and [qooxdoo], the web socket socket.io module was
used.

### [vue]

![vue-screenshot](../img/vue.png)

- **Interactive layout**
    - Not very fancy packages found for creating dynamic layouts
    - Many [vue] dedicated layouts not in a mature status
    - Better to use HTML-CSS basic solutions
    - vue-splitpane module used
- **3D renderer**
    - [three.js] library used
    - Flexible and easy to use
- **Workbench**
    - Very poor resources found to build flowcharts
    - vue-port-graph module used
- **Data binding in UI**
    - The declarative UI makes it easy to mix HTML code with JavaScript-based
logic coding
    - Built-in event bus (publish-subscribe) pattern for communication
    - Very flexible and easy to use notification system
- **Dynamic styling**
    - Easy to define styles shared between components
- **Front-end/Back-end communication**
    - vue-socket.io module used for communication
    - Easy to set up on both server and client sides
    - Publish-subscribe pattern communication
- **Extra impressions**
    - Kind of a mixture of React.js and Angular.js
    - Templating, scripting, and styling well separated
    - Lot of templating logic goes into html side code
    - Lightweight framework that needs extra third party packages/modules
to build components
    - It is growing rapidly, regularly introducing valuable new features
    - Very active community behind
    - Easy learning curve

### [react]

![react-screenshot](../img/react.jpg)

- **Interactive layout**
    - Many packages provide very good looking, interactive layouts
    - react-rnd module used
- **3D renderer**
    - react-three and react-three-renderer are modules that go on top
of [three.js]
    - react-three-renderer (not all [three.js] features are implemented in
this wrapper)
- **Workbench**
    - Very nice packages found to represent a flowchart
    - nodes and links can be extended to fit our needs
    - storm-react-diagrams module used
- **Data binding in UI**
    - redux is the most popular module for component communication
    - Based on a store, actions and reducers: mutates the states of the
components providing interactivity
- **Dynamic styling**
    - Easy to define styles shared between components
- **Front-end/Back-end communication**
    - socket.io-client together with socket.io modules used for
communication
    - Easy to set up in both server and client sides
    - Publish-subscribe pattern communication
- **Extra impressions**
    - HTML, scripting and styling well separated
    - Not easy to mix scripting with templating
    - Lot of third party packages to choose from, implementing new features
    - Very active community behind and many examples already in place
    - Linear learning curve

### [qooxdoo]

![qx-screenshot](../img/qx.png)

- **Interactive layout**
    - qx.ui.window.Window used to make it look like a Desktop application
- **3D renderer**
    - Using [three.js] directly
    - [three.js] related OrbitControls.js and ShaderSkin.js were also used
for controlling the camera and adding texture to the head model
respectively
- **Workbench**
    - jquery-flowchart.js used
    - nodes and links can be extended to fit our needs
- **Data binding in UI**
    - 'json object' -> 'model' [qooxdoo] built-in conversion used
    - Similar to redux
- **Dynamic styling**
    - Includes different themes that can be extended/customized
    - Well separated from the logic, but can be part of it
- **Front-end/Back-end communication**
    - socket.io module used
- **Extra impressions**
    - [qooxdoo] does not have a package manager (yet). Therefore, all required 3rd
party libraries need to be manually integrated. This has pros and
cons, e.g., an advantage is that dependencies are better controlled.
    - Since the community is smaller, fewer pre-built wrappers
(integration of 3rd party packages) are available.
    - On the other hand and very importantly, [qooxdoo] users typically need fewer 3rd party 
exntions,
because it is designed to be a complete UI framework, much like Qt in the C++
world.
    - crucially, [qooxdoo] comes with conventions and a framework, making Javascript
more like object-oriented languages (like C++), supporting well-
structured code and lending itself to large web-based applications.

The main difference between [vue], [react] and [qooxdoo] is that the first two
provide very light frameworks and programming concepts with simple
skeletons to start building on top of, while [qooxdoo] provides a mature
framework with a collection of UI widgets. That means that for [vue] and
[react] one needs to look for all the UI components that one may want to
add and subsequently needs to install them, using the Node Package
Manager, together with their (poorly controllable) dependencies. In [qooxdoo], instead, if the
original framework does not provide a component, you need to download
the desired package and integrate it within the project.

Based on our review, we found that [qooxdoo] is the most suitable framework
to implement the SIM-CORE's front-end.
