## Pre-selection of technologies

The technology evaluation started with a pre-selection of technologies (i.e. libraries, framework, toolkits, models, ...) for the different components of the o2S2PARC platform, namely the front-end (client-side), the web back-end (server-side), the communication models and the computational services.

The criteria used for the pre-selection consisted mainly of three factors:

- **Completeness**: the selected framework must include functions or accept extensions that support features, which are key for its purpose. For instance, a suitable web-framework must include features for routing, database models, web-security, etc., which cover the essential functionality expected for the server-side.
- **Sustainability**: the selected technology should be long-term maintainable as an open-source project. Key measures of sustainability considered here are its popularity, the support of the developers community (i.e., documentation, fixes, releases, ...), and the license terms. 
- **Productivity**: we believe that high productivity can be achieved with the right combination of a suitable framework (e.g. complete, easy-to-use, and sustainable) and the effectiveness of reusing existing functionality and previous experience of the SIM-CORE team with specific technologies. For that reason, the pre-selection should incorporate options that combine both novel as well as already established programming paradigms (e.g. languages, design-patterns, or even specific frameworks).

## Review process

After the pre-selection of technologies, the review adopted a more practical approach. Every group of technologies was tested within a given context defined in a user story. This approach is gradually adopted from simpler to more realistic scenarios, resulting in a collection of demos that are [published the project repository](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-lab/tree/master/demos). Among all demos, there are three [prototypes](parts/demos.md) that combine different technologies within the full-stack and cover realistic scenarios expected in the final platform. The specifics of each review are documented in place, next to its correspond demo. Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity, in this document we provide a summarized version of each review and the final recommendations.
