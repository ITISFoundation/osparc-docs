To decide on the proper methodology for the SIM-CORE platform, a 
technological evaluation period was fixed, during which different 
technological alternatives were explored by prototyping components of the 
foreseen platform (frequently resulting in demonstrators). In the 
process, advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives were 
established and the collected experience was used to decide on the 
structure and suitable technology to be used for the implementation of 
the SIM-CORE platform. This forms the basis for the related part of the 
[specifications](../specs/low-level.md).

The results on the **technology evaluation** are reported in three main 
blocks starting with the methodology:

- [Methodology](methodology.md) :  A brief explanation on the two-stage 
approach followed for this evaluation.

The overall [design of the system](parts/design.md) is presented and then 
every logical part/concept of the system is address separately:

- [Front-end](parts/client-side.md) : A review on client-side frameworks.
- [Web-server](parts/server-side.md) : A review on server-side 
frameworks.
- [Communication models](parts/communication.md) : A review on intra-
service communication models.
- [Computational services](parts/comp-services.md) : A review on model 
for a sustainable computational framework.

And concludes with some demonstrations and recommendations:

- [Demonstrations](parts/demos.md) : Frameworks in action
- [Conclusions](conclusion.md) : Wrap up and recommendations
