## Communication and Interoperability

In order to achieve interoperability among different services, both
within the SIM-CORE platform (e.g., among computational services) and
outside (e.g., with other SPARC-CORE services), a stable and maintainable
communication model is required.
This interprocess communication (IPC) can be established using different
technologies.
Services can communicate synchronously using a request/response model
(REST, [Apache Thrift]), or they can use asynchronous message-based
communication mechanisms, such as the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
For our review, we focused on three different technologies:

- RESTful
- RPC with [Apache Thrift]
- AMQP


## RESTful API

Almost always based on the simple and familiar HTTP protocol and widely
used today.
REST uses the HTTP verbs to get or manipulate resources that are
represented using a URL.

***Pros***

- Simple protocol
- API easily verifiable from within a browser or command line
- Does not require a broker

***Cons***

- Synchronous communication only, server must always respond
- client/server must be up and running at the same time
- URL for every service must be known

## RPC [Apache Thrift]

A framework that supports multiple languages for clients and servers by
using a compiler that auto generates code from interface definitions.
Supports C++, Java, Python, Node.js, etc. and is developed by facebook.

***Pros***

- Synchronous and asychronous communication possible
- Easy integration into already existing code
- Very fast and efficient

***Cons***

- More work to be done on the client side

## AMQP

Protocol for asynchronous message based communication.
Allows clients to communicate with each other via messages using an
intermediate broker.
Communication can be done point-to-point or one-to-all.

***Pros***

- Decoupling of client/server, client does not need to know server's
whereabouts
- Messages are buffered, client/server do not need to be up
simultaneously


***Cons***

- More parts in the system (broker)
- More work needs to be done for request/response interaction
(identification system for messages)
- If the broker dies, the system breaks down

## Conclusions

All above mentioned technologies have characteristics that satisfy the
communication needs for different parts of the SIM-CORE platform.
Our choice is the RESTful APIs for the backend-director communication as
well as for communication with the other COREs.
For the computational backend, the use of messaging for job distribution
and REST/RPC for communication with computational services is foreseen.
