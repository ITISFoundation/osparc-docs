To decide on the proper methodology for the SIM-CORE platform, a
technological evaluation period was fixed, during which different
technological alternatives were explored by prototyping components of the
foreseen platform (frequently resulting in demonstrators). In the
process, advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives were
established and the collected experience was used to decide on the
structure and suitable technology to be used for the implementation of
the SIM-CORE platform. The technology evaluation forms the basis for the related part of 
the
[specifications](../specs/low-level.md).

The results on the **technology evaluation** start with an overview of the
[design of the framework](parts/design.md) in order to define the logical parts/concepts
of the system. It is followed by a brief description of the
[methodology](methodology.md) adopted for the review process. Then, every logical
part/concept of the system is analysed separately:

- [Front-end](parts/client-side.md) : A review on client-side frameworks.
- [Web-server](parts/server-side.md) : A review on server-side
frameworks.
- [Communication models](parts/communication.md) : A review on intra-
service communication models.
- [Computational services](parts/comp-services.md) : A review on models
for a sustainable computational framework.

The technology evaluation section concludes with some demonstrations and 
recommendations:

- [Demonstrations](parts/demos.md) : Frameworks in action
- [Conclusions](conclusion.md) : Wrap up and recommendations
