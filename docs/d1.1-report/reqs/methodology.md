The SPARC awardee requirement collection was discussed during the DRC
meeting (NIH Directorate, Bethesda, 18-19 October 2017) with the SPARC
management and the DRC CORE teams. Based on that discussion, the
following approach was chosen: (i) compile an open-ended questionnaire that will
guide the modeling-needs requirement collection, with a focus on aspects
pertaining to the SIM-CORE; (ii), share the questionnaire 
with other COREs to collect input, clarify potential overlaps, and
for further refinement; (iii) schedule interviews with
SPARC awardee teams, in which the questionnaire serves as guide for the
requirement collection (though the discussion is driven by the specific
needs of the awardee teams, which can require increased discussion depth
in some areas, while other questionnaire topics might not be applicable);
(iv) based on the interviews, request additional information (publications,
models) from the awardee teams.

The [questionnaire](../reqs/Questionnaire_SPARC_Teams_v5.pdf) was subdivided into nine 
different categories: (i)
data generation; (ii) general modeling; (iii) modeling organ anatomy, nerve
trajectories, connectomes; (iv) modelling and simulating electrophysiology;
(v) coupling electrophysiology and multiphysics simulations; (vi) online
platform: user perspective; (vii) postprocessing: visualization and
analysis; IT resources, contribution to development; (viii) project-specific
issues; (ix) miscellaneous.

Interviews typically lasted
two hours and occasionally were followed by further discussions. They were held with 
groups which had been specifically pointed
out by the SPARC management as being part of particularly large SPARC projects with an
already significantly present modeling component, i.e., Howard/colon (Joel
Bornstein, Melbourne); Shiv/cardiac (Kember Nova Scotia/Clancy UCI);
Powley/stomach (Matt Ward, Indiana/Purdue); Bolser/lung (Morris, UF);
Grill/vagus (Duke); Jenkins/IR (CWRU). 
Contact with other teams and related requirement collection has also taken
place in the context of the SPARC DRC Launch and PI meeting (16-17
November 2017), as a result of both direct referral by the SPARC management to
the SIM-CORE of teams planning modeling related submissions, and by IT'IS
initiative. These meetings were typically shorter and, due to the limited time available, did 
not reach
the full depth of the questionnaire topics. During all interviews and meetings, at
least two experts from IT'IS were present who had a follow-up discussion to identify 
potential areas, in
which the current SIM-CORE vision might require adaptation.
