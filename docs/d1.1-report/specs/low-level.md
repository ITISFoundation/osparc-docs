The framework shall serve a website designed to provide any SIM-CORE user with
functionality for building, pipelining, scheduling, and running computational models. These
models and the associated information (sometimes denoted as metadata) can be provided
by the user himself and/or pulled/pushed/searched from/to, e.g., the DAT- or MAP-CORE.  
The SIM-CORE shall define its own user entry-point and shall interface to the other CORE's
services and/or APIs.

Regarding technology, the [front-end](../tech/parts/client-side.md) shall be implemented in the [qooxdoo]
framework. For the [web server](../tech/parts/server-side.md) [flask],  a python web framework, shall be
the preferred technology. The [computational services](../tech/parts/comp-services.md)
shall be encapsulated in [docker] containers and orchestrated using [swarm]. Docker
containerization of computational services provides an ideal solution for sustainability since
the original user applications will run in the framework within environments closely
resembling the environments in which they were conceived, without requiring major
modifications to interact with the orchestrator or communicate with other services.
The [communication](../tech/parts/communication.md) between services shall be accomplished with
[apache-thrift] or a REST-API. The former shall be the preferred method for internal services,
while the latter shall be used to interact with APIs of external services.

The platform, as well as the computational services, shall be designed to be deployed and
run in the cloud.

The performance of the different modules/parts will continue to be monitored as user
stories are successively implemented in the development process, and if necessary, the
above described technological approaches will be adapted. Special attention will have to be
paid to the orchestration of computational services and the responsiveness of the web-UI
when large CAD models are manipulated or transmitted.
